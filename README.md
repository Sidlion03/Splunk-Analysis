# Splunk-Analysis
This is a repository where i do and post my splunk projects

I have done some searchs in splunk and gone through a sample  DNS and HTTP log file .

I uloaded the files and added some interesting fields in splunk to further group data ,
and make it easier to filter it .

all the screenshots are uploaded of me going through the steps ,
and the log files of the results of the searchs are included as well .

Thank You
